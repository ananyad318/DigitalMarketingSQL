## Introduction

### The data provides insights into the effectiveness and profitability of various marketing campaigns across different categories and dates. 
It reflects some facts about what happened - how much was spent, revenue earned, how customers behaved (who clicked on the ad banner, who signed up, who paid).
Through this project, I have calculated marketing metrics that would help evaluate performance and identify some parameters of the campaign that would be important for analysis.

Columns of the dataset:
- id: Unique identifier for each entry
- c_date: Date of the campaign
- campaign_name: Name of the campaign
- category: Category of the campaign (e.g., social, search, influencer, media)
- campaign_id: Unique identifier for each campaign
- impressions: Number of impressions generated by the campaign
- mark_spent: Amount spent on the campaign
- clicks: Number of clicks received
- leads: Number of leads generated
- orders: Number of orders made
- revenue: Revenue generated from the campaign

## **General Insights**
