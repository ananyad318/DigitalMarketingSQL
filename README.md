# *Analystics on Digital Marketing Metrices*
 ## The data provides insights into the effectiveness and profitability of various marketing campaigns across different categories and dates. It reflects some facts about what happened - how much was spent, amounts earned, how customers behaved (who clicked on the ad banner, who signed up, who paid).
Through this project I have calculated marketing metrics that would help evaluate performance and identify some parameters of the campaign that would be important for analysis.
